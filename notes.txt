libraries or framwoers

React is a lib 
Anglar is a framework  - in itself so many lobrarie so
servives http animation testing 

axios redux 
Angular says if u have to something if u creating a componnet u have to register first 
install a module import a module and then use it 



create a component and use it 
install and modules and use it 

All of these are javascript 
Ecma script  - - specification where all the keywords are mentione dthat how to use js 

for example a specification that to declare a varibale var 

Browsers and nodejs work on which version of ES --- veriosn 5 

version 6 (partially )

some of words are allowed and ome are not 

we need to conver es6 into es5 that

converting es6 into es5 is known as transpilling

Vraibales and data 
datatypes 
js takes care of datatype 
Dynamic 
variables are which will store data 

var variable_name =  value 
var x = 10

name  = "Nishi"


x =  ["ashu", 10]
x =  {}   // object 

what is an object data structure key value pairs seperated via comma

var user = {
    name:"Ashu",
    role:"trainer",
    id:343234,
    phone:3435345,
    email:"ashu.lekhi",
    phone:4239493
}

object.keyname

user.phone

var xy =  function(){}
xy =90

function xyzpqr(){

}

>>>>>>>>>>> Scopes >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

local/functional and global 
everywhere 
local only inside functions 

what happens in vegas stays inside vegas 
what happens in functions stays inside functions 

block level scoping 


var x  // declaration 
x = 10 // definition 

var y =20

ONLY  THE DECLARARTION PART IS TAKEN TO THE TOP is known as varibale Hoisting  


because of delaration of local variable we will never access the global 


if we do not have local declaration then we will access global

// no function overloading 
// only one the later one 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Day 2  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
// in javasctript we have a term known as context of execution 

which is where is a function is called or called by 

this function defined isnisde timeout(function) is called by timeout method whoch belong to some other class so this will take the valeu of context of ececution 

in order to preserve the scope of this operator we use arror functions 



let square = function(num){
    return num*num
}

let sq = (num)=>{num*num}

people say arrow functions are to reduce lines of code 

but no arrow functions are used to preserver the scope of this operaotr 



// one time installation of CRA (create-react-app)


// npx create-react-app projectname

// cd projectname

// npm start


//  static and not static resources 

index.html is refereing two images image src=""
which i am serving using http server and if two images are kept in a folder can i access those 2 images in index.html 

package lock is mantinained by package.json to get veriosn history 

var name = "ashu"  js
<label>Ashu</label>  html tags


html in js file it is known as jsx 
javascrript xml

ashu calls js extension becuase it extending the powers of js to understand html tags also this is only possible in react 

var button  = <button>Login</button>


what is a component ??? what ever u see 
component is a view 

technically a component is html returned by a function 


// Steps to use a component 
// 1) create a component 
// 2 export a component 
3) import and use it in capital casing 

<button> vs <button> , thats why all the user defined components are capitals 


jsx restrictions 

are tags must be closed 
style = "height:10px ; width:100%"
style  = {{height:"20px", width:"100%", backgroundColor:""}}


props is an object in which values can be passed in tag in below syntax
<ComponnenName prop1="value1" prop2="value2" propn="value2" />
Props is an obect in which data can be passed from parent to child component


in functional components once data is shown to UI it cant be updated on the screen


For that we have STATE 

what is STATE .. STATE is an object which contains data to be shown to UI which can be updated 

Step 1
// create the state / initialise the state


Step 2 )
 Update the state by calling a function setState() whwenver required to change the value of the data shown in UI


 setState does not replace/overrides the state object it merges the state object
 if any key is updating it will update the value of that key 


 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Day 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 2 types of components 
 Stateless   - functional components
 Statefull   - class based 

 State full component is the one which can access state features state object and lifecycle methods 
 Another is life cycle methods . From construction  of component to destrcution of a component 

 it goe through several phases it is mounted it receive props it gets updates unmount 

 constructor 
 render
 cmponendDidMount()  is called when rndering it successfully completed because it may happen that component started to come on screen but any other component inside that was not correct 
 componentDidUpdate()
 componentEillUnmount()


 Pure Component is the component which only rerenders if the state value is getting changed not if setSTate() is called everytime 
 Component rerenders everytime on setSTate() even if the value of state is same
 


 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> React HOOKS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 React hooks are the ones which provided us statefull features in functional component 
 What is Reach hooks . Are functions 

 useSTate()

 useState is a react hook which gives state to functional component 

 let [stateproperty, hanlerof stateproperty] = useSTate()

 in class this.state = {}
 this.setState({erromessage:"Invalid Credentials})

 let [errormessage,setErrormessage] = useState(undefined)
 setErrormessage("Invalid credentials)

 I dont give a damn on uodate . We only to want to implement didmount but not didupdate

 useEffect(()=>{},[]) this array is known as list of depencies on which we have to watch for the changes 

 [] blank array means we are not looking for change in any property

 [name] means it is looking for change in the property name

 without Array [] called on every update 
 with blank array will not be called on any update setErrormessage
 array with some value it will be onlu called on change of those values

 Programatical ROuting 
 Query in routes
 Params in route 


 Program routing is routing from javascript that means first we will call a function and from that function we will navigate to a path 

 From Program we need a history object which contains a funtion known as push()

 whereever we want to navigate history.push(path)
 from where this history comes ?


 Route tag add some additional props to these components 


 withRouter (HOC) provided for adding route props 


 /login /signup /search these are rutes any route can take query we add question mark to routes and send key=value 

 /search?a=10&b=20&user=ashu.lekhi@gmail.com&password=test&x=something


 We need to parse query string so we will install query-string 
npm i query-string


Context Provider Consumer
